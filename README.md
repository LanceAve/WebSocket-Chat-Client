# WebSocket Chat App

A lightweight, cross-platform chat prototype built using Node.js, WebSockets, and MongoDB.  

It enables real-time communication between a SwiftUI iOS client and a browser-based HTML client.

The HTML client was initially created for testing backend functionality, and later evolved to interoperate seamlessly with the SwiftUI client.
